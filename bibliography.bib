  abstract = {This book provides an introduction to the development of three-dimensional climate models, including their four major components: atmosphere, ocean, land/vegetation, and sea ice. The fundamental processes in each component and the interactions among them are explained using basic scientific principles, and elements of the numerical methods used in solving the model equations are also provided. The authors show how the theory and models grew historically and how well they are able to account for known aspects of the climate system. This book is written so that a reader who is only vaguely aware of climate models will be able to gain an understanding of what the models are attempting to simulate, how the models are constructed, what the models have succeeded in simulating, and how the models are being used. Examples illustrating the use of the models to simulate aspects of the current climate system are followed by examples illustrating the application of the models to important scientific areas such as understanding paleoclimates, the last millennium, the El Nino/Southern Oscillation, and the effects of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations on future climate change. The book is appropriate for scientists, graduate students, and upper-level undergraduates and can be used as a textbook or for self study and reference. The authors have considerably updated the book from the first edition by adding descriptions of many techniques and results developed since the mid-1980s.},

  abstract = {The increasing interest in the climate in general and, in particular, in the role that Arctic processes play within it has led to an increasing demand for accurate predictions for sea ice motion. However, the problem of finding suitable equations to accurately describe the drift and deformation of the sea ice cover has challenged the sea ice dynamics community for many years. This thesis presents the developments in sea ice modeling research, from its origins to the current state focusing on models based on a continuum mechanics framework. To do so, we will first describe the relevant sea ice state parameters: sea ice velocity, sea ice thickness, sea ice concentration, internal sea ice stresses and sea ice properties like cohesion as well as the equations describing their time evolution. Special attention will be devoted to the formulation of the internal stress as function of the (rate of) deformation, i.e. the rheology. This relation changed from being absent, as the earliest models did not include internal stresses, via a simple linear relation, similar to the one found in a viscous fluid, to rheologies in which ice can exhibit different relations below and above a critical stress threshold given by a yield curve. The Mohr-Coulomb curve and elliptic yield curves will be discussed. Subcritical ice behavior is either elastic, viscous or a combination of the two. Supercritical ice deforms plastically. Discussed examples of such rheologies are the elastic-plastic (EP) and viscous-plastic (VP) rheologies. As a consequence of the need to stay within the yield curve, the viscosity and/or elasticity needs to change. It has been found that models are more capable of reproducing features in the sea ice if the processes happening at a lower scale than the model spatial resolution are parametrized. This has resulted in the development of the the Elasto-Brittle (EB), the Maxwell-Elasto- Brittle (MEB) and the Brittle-Bingham-Maxwell (BBM) rheologies. The latter is the current state-of-art model rheology successful in reproducing the multifractal nature of sea ice deformation in both space and time, i.e. the characteristic heterogeneity and intermittency.},
